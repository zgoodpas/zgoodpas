## Hi there 👋
### 🧑‍💻 About me: 
I'm a GIT student at ASU living in California in the Sacramento metro area.
- 🔭 I’m currently studying Graphic Information Technology (GIT) with a minor in Human Systems Engineering. After I graduate, my goal is to get a career in the field of UX/UI/web design and front-end development!
- 👾 For coding, I enjoy learning more about HTML and CSS; I took an introductory computer science course in high school that taught me the absolute basics of HTML, so it's fun getting to learn more about it! I would like to learn Javascript too, as well as other common coding languages.
- 🌱 Outside of work and school, I love playing video games, listening to music, reading books, and watching the latest shows on Netflix!
